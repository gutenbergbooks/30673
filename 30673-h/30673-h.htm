<h1>SOUND OF<br />
<span class="sp1">TERROR</span></h1>

<h2>BY DON BERRY</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The day</span> was still no more
than a ragged streak of red in
the east; the pre-dawn air was
sharply cold, making Johnny
Youngbear's face feel slightly brittle
as he dressed quietly in the gray
bedroom.</p>

<p>He sat down on the bed, pulling
on his boots, and felt his wife stir
sleepily beneath the covers. Suddenly
she stiffened, sat upright in
the bed, startled into wakefulness.
Johnny put one dark, bony hand
on her white shoulder, gently, reassuring.
After a moment, finding
herself, she turned away and lit a
cigarette. Johnny finished pulling
on his boots and stood, his hawk-like
face unreadable in the cold
gray light streaming through the
huge picture window.</p>

<p>"Johnny?" said his wife hesitantly.</p>

<p>He murmured an acknowledgement,
watching the bright flare of
color as she drew on the cigarette.
Her soft, dark hair was coiled loosely
around her shoulders, very black
against the pale skin. Her eyes were
invisible in shadow, and Johnny
could not read their expression. He
turned away, knowing she was
watching him.</p>

<p>"Be careful," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Try," he said. Then he
shrugged. "Not my day, anyway."</p>

<p>"I know," she said. "But&mdash;be
careful."</p>

<p>He left the house and walked out
into the chill desert dawn. He
turned his face to the brightness in
the east, trying to catch a little
warmth, but could not.</p>

<p>He warmed up the jeep, listening
to the engine grumble protest
until it settled to a flat, banging
roar. He swerved out of the driveway
with a screaming of tires.
Reaching the long ribbon of concrete
that led out into the desert,
he settled down hard on the accelerator,
indifferent to the whining
complaint of the jeep's motor.</p>

<p>It was eight miles from his
sprawling house to the Mesa Dry
Lake launching site, due east, into
the sun. He pulled to the top of Six
Mile Hill and stopped in the middle
of the highway. Two miles ahead
was Launching Base I, throwing
long, sharp shadows at him in the
rosy dawn light. A cluster of squat,
gray blockhouses; a long runway
tapering into the distance with an
Air Force B-52 motionless at the
near end; that was all.</p>

<p>Except the Ship.</p>

<p>The Ship towered high, dominating
the desert like a pinnacle of
bright silver. Even silhouetted
against the eastern sky, it sparkled
and glistened. Impassive it stood,
graceful, seeming to strain into the
sky, anxious to be off and gone. The
loading gantry was a dark, spidery
framework beside The Ship, leaning
against it, drawing strength
from its sleek beauty.</p>

<p>Johnny watched it in silence for
a moment, then turned his eyes up,
to the sky. Somewhere up there a
tiny satellite spun wildly about the
earth, a little silver ball in some
celestial roulette wheel. Gradually
it would spiral closer and closer,
caught by the planet's implacable
grasp, until it flared brightly like a
cigarette in the heavens before dissolving
into drops of molten metal.</p>

<p>But it would have served its purpose.
In its short life it would have
given Man knowledge; knowledge
of space, knowledge enough that he
could go himself, knowing what he
would find in the emptiness between
the earth and the moon. Or
knowing nearly.</p>

<p><i>What's it like out there?</i></p>

<p>The satellite answered partly;
the Ship would answer more.</p>

<p>Johnny slammed the jeep into
gear, hurtled down the other side
of Six Mile Hill. Through his mind
ran the insistent repetition of an old
song he knew, and he hummed it
tunelessly through closed teeth.</p>

<p><i>I had a true wife but I left her
... oh, oh, oh.</i></p>

<p>The jeep skidded to a halt beside
Control. Mitch Campbell's green
station wagon was already there,
creaking and settling as the motor
cooled.</p>

<p>Control was full of people; Air
Force brass, technicians, observers,
enlisted men of indiscernible purpose.
The room hummed with the
muted buzz of low, serious conversation.</p>

<p>Mitch Campbell sat in one corner,
apparently forgotten in the
confusion. He had nothing to do.
Not yet. He was already in flight
dress, holding the massive helmet in
his hands morosely, turning it over
and over, staring at it as though he
thought he might find his head inside
if he looked carefully enough.</p>

<p>"Morning, Colonel," said Johnny,
forcing his voice to be casual
and cheerful. "You're up early this
morning."</p>

<p>"Morning, Colonel, yourself," said
Mitch, looking up.</p>

<p>"Big date today?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yeah, you might say so,"
Mitch said, smiling faintly and with
obvious effort. "Thought I might
go once around lightly," he said,
hooking his thumb upwards. Upwards
through the concrete ceiling,
into the air, through the air, up
where there was no air for a man
to breathe. Once around lightly.</p>

<p>Around the world. Lightly.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, Mitch."</p>

<p>"O.K., tell me what," he said.</p>

<p>"You like the movies?" Johnny
asked. "You like to get a little adventure
in your soul? You like a little
vicarious thrill now and then?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I like that."</p>

<p>"Tell you what. We'll go. No,
don't thank me. We'll go. Tonight.
Eight o'clock, you come by."</p>

<p>"Wives and everybody?" Mitch
asked.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Johnny said.
"They're cooped up in the house
all day."</p>

<p>They both knew the wives would
be in Control in an hour, listening
to the radio chatter, waiting, eyes
wide, shoulders stiff and tight.</p>

<p>"Fine," said Mitch. "Fine."</p>

<p>A crew-chief came up and
touched Johnny's shoulder. "Colonel
Youngbear," he said, "Observation
is going up."</p>

<p>Johnny stood and looked out the
tiny window at the red-painted
B-52.</p>

<p>"See you tonight, Mitch. Eight
o'clock? Don't forget. Westerns."</p>

<p>"See you," said Mitch. He looked
back down at the helmet and was
turning it over and over again
when Johnny left.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The Observation</span> B-52 climbed,
screaming.</p>

<p>Johnny lit a cigarette and
watched out the port at the contrails
rolling straight and white behind
the jets.</p>

<p>He sat by the radioman, a Sergeant,
ignoring the rest of the officers
in the converted bomb-bay.</p>

<p>"Hope he makes it, Colonel,"
said the Sergeant.</p>

<p>"He'll make it," Johnny said flatly,
irritated. Relenting, he added in
a gentler tone, "The pilot section
breaks away. If he gets in serious
trouble, he can dump it and ride
the nose down. Like a bird. He'll
make it."</p>

<p>There was a raucous buzz, and a
squawk box said: "On my mark it
will be Zero minus four minutes ...
mark!" The voice of Control, 35,000
feet below.</p>

<p>The B-52 swung ponderously onto
the base leg of its circle, and
there was a creaking of stretching
metal inside.</p>

<p>"Minus two minutes." <i>Not my
day, anyway</i>, Johnny thought. He
lit another cigarette.</p>

<p>"Control," said a new voice,
"This is Red Leader. Red Leader.
Red Flight is in position."</p>

<p>"Rog, Red Leader," Control acknowledged.
The Observation flight
of jet fighters was waiting, too.</p>

<p>"Minus five ... four ... three
... two ... one ... mark!"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p><i>I had a true wife but I left her
... oh, oh, oh.</i></p>

<p>There was another rattle of the
speaker, and Mitch's voice came
through, grunting, heavy, as the acceleration
of the Ship laid a heavy
hand on his chest.</p>

<p>"Acceleration ... eight gee ...
controls respond."</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"There he is," someone said. A
wavering trail of smoke was barely
visible below, a thread of white,
coming up fast, blown erratically
by winds into a distorted tiny snake.</p>

<p>"Altitude ..." said Mitch's voice,
"40,000.... Acceleration ... dropping."</p>

<p>The white snake wriggled up to
their level, rose above them. Johnny
could not see the silver head.</p>

<p>"Altitude ... 65,000.... I have a
loud, very high buzz in my headphones.
I'm going to&mdash;there, it's
gone now, went out of my range."</p>

<p>His voice sounded wrong to
Johnny, but he couldn't pin it
down.</p>

<p>"Altitude ... 105,000. Beginning
orbital correction. Beginning&mdash;beginning
... I can't&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;"
The voice became unintelligible. It
was pitched very high, like a woman's,
and it sounded as if his teeth
were chattering.</p>

<p>"Mitch," Johnny pleaded softly.
"Mitch, baby. Dump it, boy, come
on home, now. Dump it."</p>

<p>There was no more from the
speaker. A confused babble broke
out in the bomb-bay. The Sergeant
fiddled with his dials frantically,
spinning across wavelengths, trying
to find a word. The confusion
ceased when the speaker rattled
again, seeming hours later.</p>

<p>"Uh, hello, Control, this is Red
Three, do you read me?" One of
the fighter flight.</p>

<p>"Rog, Red Three, go ahead,"
came Control's voice from below.</p>

<p>"Uh, Control, I have a flash and
smoke cloud on a bearing of three-seven
degrees."</p>

<p>"Red Three, what altitude?
What altitude?"</p>

<p>"None," said the fighter pilot.
"On the deck."</p>

<p>After a moment, Johnny climbed
unsteadily to his feet in the midst
of a booming silence. He made his
way back along the catwalk to the
head, where he retched violently
until the tears came to his eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Three weeks</span> later, Johnny
sat in Doctor Lambert's office.
He watched the lean, graying
psychologist turn off the tape recorder,
watched him methodically
tamp tobacco in his pipe.</p>

<p>"That's all she wrote, Johnny,"
said Lambert, finally. "That recording
of Mitch's voice is just
about all we have. The Ship was
under full power when it hit. There
wasn't much left."</p>

<p>Johnny looked absently out the
window at the gleaming needle of
Ship II beside the flimsy-looking
gantry. Full power was a lot of
power.</p>

<p>The psychologist followed Johnny's eyes.
"Beautiful," he said, and
the word brought to Johnny's mind
the wide-eyed pale face of Mitch's
wife, staring at him.</p>

<p>"That Ship is the best we can
make her," Lambert said. "Engineering
is as certain as they can be
that there was no structural failure
on Ship I."</p>

<p>"So?" Johnny said, still staring at
the Ship. Even at this distance, he
could almost believe he could see
his own lean face reflected in the
shining metal.</p>

<p>"So we look somewhere else for
the cause of failure," said Lambert.</p>

<p>"Where?" said Johnny. He
turned back, saw that the psychologist
was putting a new reel on the
tape recorder.</p>

<p>"The weak link in the control
system," Lambert said.</p>

<p>"There weren't any."</p>

<p>"One."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Mitch Campbell."</p>

<p>Johnny stood, angry. "Mitch was
good. Damn good."</p>

<p>The psychologist looked up, and
his eyes were tired. "I know it," he
said calmly. "Listen to this." He
started the machine playing the
new tape.</p>

<p>Johnny listened to it through.
The voice that came out was high
and wavering. It shook, it chattered,
words were indistinguishable.
It was thin with tension, and it
rang in Johnny's ears with unwanted
familiarity.</p>

<p>"What's it sound like to you?"
Lambert asked when it had finished.</p>

<p>"Like Mitch's voice," Johnny admitted
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"It did to me, too. What do you
think it is?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Johnny shortly.
"Might be a pilot whose plane is
shaking apart."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Lambert sat back down behind
his desk and sucked on his pipestem.
He regarded Johnny impassively,
seeming to consider some
problem remote from the room.</p>

<p>Abruptly, he stood again and
went to the window, watching the
ant-like activity around the base of
Ship II.</p>

<p>"That was a madman's voice,"
he said. "I made the recording
while I was interning at a state institution."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"Mad with fear," Lambert said.
"Pure. Simple. Unadulterated.
That was the sound of terror you
heard, Johnny. Terror such as few
humans have ever known. That
man knew such fear he could not
remain sane and live with it."</p>

<p><i>I had a true wife but I left her
... oh, oh, oh.</i></p>

<p>"You think Mitch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You said yourself the voices
were alike." Lambert pointed out.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Don't have to," said Lambert,
turning from the window. "But I'll
tell you something, Johnny. That
Ship&mdash;" he hooked his thumb out
the window&mdash;"is a very big toy.
Maybe too big."</p>

<p>"Meaning?"</p>

<p>"Meaning it's possible we've
reached beyond Man's limitations.
Meaning it's possible we've built
something too big for a man to
handle and stay sane. Maybe we've
finally gone too far."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"I don't insist it's true," said the
psychologist. "It's an idea. Fear.
Fear of the unknown, maybe. Too
much fear to hold."</p>

<p>"You think I'll crack?" asked
Johnny.</p>

<p>The psychologist didn't answer
directly. "It's an idea, as I said. I
just wanted you to think it over."</p>

<p>"I will," said Johnny. He stood
again, his jaw held tight. "Is that
all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Colonel, that's all," said
Lambert.</p>

<p>When Johnny left, the psychologist
sat in brooding silence, staring
morosely at a trail of blue smoke
rising from his pipe bowl. He sat
there until the afternoon light faded
from the desert base. Then he stood
in the darkened office, sighed, lit
his pipe and went home. He was
very tired.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Six weeks</span> later, Johnny
Youngbear walked out of the
Control blockhouse into the cold
desert morning, carrying his helmet
under his arm.</p>

<p>He ran his eyes swiftly up the
length of Ship II, trying to forget
those other eyes staring at his back
from the blockhouse. The Ship rippled
and gleamed, alive, eager, the
thundering power in her belly waiting
to be born.</p>

<p><i>Oh, you bitch! You beautiful
bitch</i>, Johnny thought. <i>Pregnant
with power like a goddess with a
god's child. Bitch, bitch, bitch! I
love you. I hate you. You kill me.</i></p>

<p>The crew-chief walked by his
side. "Nice morning, Colonel," he
said.</p>

<p>"Very," said Johnny.</p>

<p><i>I had a true wife but I left her
... oh, oh, oh. For you, you beautiful
bitch.</i></p>

<p>"Say something, Colonel?" asked
the crew-chief.</p>

<p>"No. Song running through my
head," he explained.</p>

<p>"Yeah," the other man chuckled.
"I know how it is."</p>

<p>They strapped him into the padded
control chair, the controls arranged
around him in a neat semicircle,
easy to reach.</p>

<p><i>This is my day.</i></p>

<p>They left him. Alone. <i>Once
around lightly.</i></p>

<p>The loneliness was in his belly,
aching like a tumor.</p>

<p>"... read me?" Control's voice
in his earphones.</p>

<p>"Loud and clear," he said absently.</p>

<p>"... minus two minutes ...
mark!" A different voice. So many
different voices. They knew him,
they talked to him. But he was alone
with his bitch.</p>

<p><i>I had a true wife but&mdash;</i></p>

<p>"... minus one minute ...
mark!"</p>

<p><i>This is my day I had a true
wife&mdash;</i></p>

<p>"... three ... two ... one ...
mark!"</p>

<p>There was the sound of a world
dying in his mind, the sound of
thunder, the sound of a sun splitting,
the sound of a goddess giving
birth, with pain with agony in loneliness.</p>

<p>A giant's fist came from out of
nothingness and smashed into his
body. His chest was compressed, his
face was flattened, he could not get
enough air to breathe. The heavy
sledge of acceleration crushed him
back into the padded chair, inexorable,
implacable, relentless, heavy.
His vision clouded in red and he
thought he would die. Instead, he
spoke into the lip mike, resenting
it bitterly.</p>

<p>"Acceleration ... nine gee." He
looked at the gauge that shimmered
redly before him, disbelieving. "Altitude
20,000."</p>

<p>He blacked out, sinking helplessly
into the black plush night of unawareness.
<i>I had a true I had I
had&mdash;</i></p>

<p>Awakening to pain, he glanced
at the gauges. He had been gone
only a split second.</p>

<p>"Altitude 28,000, acceleration
pressure dropping."</p>

<p>His face began to resume its normal
shape as the acceleration
dropped. "... six gee," he said, and
breathing was easier. The giant reluctantly
began to withdraw his
massive fist from Johnny's face.</p>

<p>He tipped a lever, watched the
artificial horizon tilt slightly. "Air
control surfaces respond," he said.
But soon there would be no air for
the surfaces to move against, and
then he would control by flicking
the power that rumbled behind
him.</p>

<p>"Altitude 40,000 ...</p>

<p>"... 85,000 ...</p>

<p>"... 100,000...." The sky was
glistening black, he was passing
from the earth's envelope of air into
the nothingness that was space.
Now.</p>

<p>Now.</p>

<p>Now it was time to change angle,
flatten the ship out, bring it into
position to run around the earth.
<i>Once around lightly.</i></p>

<p>There was a high-pitched scream
in his earphones. He remembered
it had been there for long, and
wondered if he had told Control.</p>

<p>He flicked the switch that ignited
the powerful steering rockets, and
the whine grew louder, unbearably
loud. It sang to him, his bitch sang,
<i>I had a true wife, but I left her ...
oh, oh, oh.</i></p>

<p>He began to feel a light tingle
over his body, tiny needles delicately
jabbing every inch. His face became
wooden, felt prickly. He tried
to lick his lips and could feel no
sensation there. His vision fogged
again, and he knew it was not from
acceleration this time, it was something
else.</p>

<p>Something else.</p>

<p><i>What's it like out there?</i></p>

<p>His belly told him. Fear.</p>

<p>He reached out his hand to touch
the control panel, and his arm did
not respond. It was shaking, uncontrollably,
and moved off to the
right of where he wanted it to go.
When he tried to correct, it swung
too far to the left, waving as if it
were alive. It hung there before
him as in a dream, oscillating back
and forth.</p>

<p>He could not control his body,
and the realization nurtured the
tiny seed of panic that lay heavily
in his belly.</p>

<p><i>Dump it....</i></p>

<p>What did that mean? <i>Dump it
... go home now, baby ...</i> I had <i>a true ...</i></p>

<p>Decision ... there was a decision
he had to make, but he was too
frightened to know what it was.</p>

<p>He had been born in fear and
lived in fear and his body was full
of it, quivering to the lover's touch
of fear. Falling, darkness, the fear
of dying, the unknown, the unimaginable
always lurking just out of the
corner of his eye.</p>

<p>He wanted to scream and the
fear choked it off. His hands were
at his sides, limply useless, dangling
at the seat. He had to hang on to
something. His hand found a projection
at the side of the seat. He
clutched it desperately.</p>

<p>He knew he would fall, down,
spiraling, weightless, off the cliff as
in a dream, off the ladder, the tree,
he was a child and his toes were
tingling as he stood too near the
edge of the cliff, knowing he might
fall.</p>

<p>He clutched tightly, putting every
ounce of his strength into holding
on to the lever, the single solid
reality in a world of shifting unreality.
He was going to fall he was
falling I love you I hate you I had
a true wife ...</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There was</span> softness beneath
his back, and he moved his
hands, feeling the crispness of
sheets. There was a low murmur of
voices. He raised his hands to his
eyes and the voices stopped. There
were heavy bandages on his eyes.</p>

<p>"Colonel?" came a questing
voice, and Johnny realized it was
Doctor Lambert. "Awake?"</p>

<p>"I can't see. Why can't I see?"</p>

<p>"You'll be all right. It's all right."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"How much do you remember?"
asked the voice. "The blast-off?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I remember that."</p>

<p>"The orbit? The landing?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not that."</p>

<p>"You did it," said the voice. "You
made it."</p>

<p><i>This is my day. Once around
lightly.</i></p>

<p>"Johnny," said the voice. "I don't
know just how to say this. We know
what was wrong with Ship I, and
why it killed Mitch. We know&mdash;hell,
we don't even begin to realize
what we have at our fingertips now.
It's so big it's impossible to evaluate."</p>

<p>"What? I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sound, Johnny, sound. Or
rather, vibration. It's something
we're just beginning to learn about.
We know a few things; we know
you can boil water with sound if
the frequency is high enough. And
you can drill metal with it&mdash;and it
does things to the human body.</p>

<p>"There are frequencies of sound
which can act directly on human
nerves, directly on the human
brain. It means that if we know the
right frequency, we'll be able to
produce any state we want in a
man, any emotion. Fear, anguish,
anything.</p>

<p>"When the steering rockets were
cut in, the Ship began to vibrate. It
generated frequencies so high that
ordinary human senses couldn't detect
them. And when your nerves
were exposed to those vibrations, it
produced fear. Pure and absolute
fear. Motor control went, rational
processes went, all the nervous functions
of the body went out of control.
Your body became a giant tuning
fork, and the frequency to which
it vibrated was fear.</p>

<p>"I can't remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sanity went, too, Johnny," said
the man softly. "You could not
stand that fear and remain sane, so
something cut off. That was what
happened to Mitch."</p>

<p>"How did I get back?"</p>

<p>"We don't know. The films show
your face suddenly going blank.
Then you flew. That's all. We
hoped you could tell us."</p>

<p>"No. No&mdash;I don't remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was something in you so
strong it overrode everything else,
even the fear. We'd like to know
what it is. We'll find out, Johnny,
and it will mean a lot to the human
race when we do."</p>

<p><i>This is my day.</i></p>

<p>"Is my wife here?"</p>

<p>There was a cool hand on his
forehead. "Yes, Johnny."</p>

<p>"Well," he said helplessly. "Well,
how are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Johnny," she whispered,
and there was the sound of
tears in her voice. "I'm just fine."</p>

<p>He felt the warm softness of her
lips on his.</p>

<p><i>I had a true wife but I left her
... oh, oh, oh.</i></p>

<p>And then he came home again.</p>
